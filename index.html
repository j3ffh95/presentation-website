      <p>
        In many parts of the world soccer is known as football, or even American
        football. It is the most popular sport in the world, being played in
        more than 200 countries. Approximately 250 million people play soccer
        around the world every year, and it has been an Olympic sport since
        1900.

        In the early 1800s soccer was invented in Newgate Prison in London by
        prisoners who had been punished for stealing. Their punishment had been
        to have their hands cut off.

      <p>
        Soccer fields are called pitches. Pitch and slope have the same meaning
        in soccer. If the field is a regulation field, it slopes 5 degrees up,
        from one end of the field to the other. Teams switch goal nets during
        the game so they both have the same uphill slope for half the game.
