        around the world every year, and it has been an Olympic sport since
        1900.

        Soccer fields are called pitches. Pitch and slope have the same meaning
        in soccer. If the field is a regulation field, it slopes 5 degrees up,
        from one end of the field to the other. Teams switch goal nets during
        the game so they both have the same uphill slope for half the game.
